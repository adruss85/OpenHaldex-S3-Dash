# TODO

What is deliberately not built, not verified, or not decided. Kept separate
from the README so the README can describe what *is*, and this can describe
what *might be*, without either one lying.

Ordering inside each group is roughly "what would hurt most if it bit us"
downwards.

---

## 1. Waiting on a decision

### 1.1 Rescue access point
If the dash's SSID or password is set wrongly, it cannot join the controller's
access point — so it cannot fetch data, and the over-the-air update page is
unreachable. USB is the only way back.

The fix: if the station has failed to join for ~3 minutes, raise our own access
point (`ohx-dash-rescue`), put the address on the glass, and serve the same
update page plus a way to fix the stored credentials. Roughly a softAP, a
small DHCP server and one more page; maybe 60–80 KB of flash.

**Deferred, not rejected.** An edge case you have to walk into on purpose.
Worth doing if this ever ships to someone who cannot reach the USB port.

### 1.2 Authenticate the update page
Right now anyone on the controller's access point can flash the dash. That is
a different risk class from the mode switch — a stranger changing the Haldex
map is annoying, a stranger writing your firmware is not — and the open access
point is broadcast, so "who is on it" is everyone in range.

Cheapest fix: a 6-digit code in the URL, shown on the dash's SETTINGS page next
to the address. Not a login, just enough that the page cannot be *found* by a
casual passer-by. Alternatives: leave it (consistent with treating an open
access point as a warning, which is the current stance on the mode switch), or
require the AP password as a token.

### 1.3 Build a `firmware.factory.bin` release asset too?
Releases carry `firmware.bin` (what the update page wants). A board that has
never been flashed, or one whose app slots have been scrambled, needs the
factory image written at `0x0` instead. One line of release notes, or a second
asset — decide when the first person asks.

### 1.4 Automatic FWD while cruise control is active — **paused**
The **read-only half is built**: `chassis.cpp` decodes `MO2_GRAregelt` (0x288,
bit 26, "regulating to a set speed") and `GRA_MainSwitch` (0x38A, bit 8, the
column switch — "armed", which is not the same thing), and they drive the **CC**
lamp: dark green armed, bright green while the engine is actually holding a
speed. That is what `can_relay.cpp`'s `cruise` value carries.

The half that **acts is not built**: nothing switches the Haldex mode to FWD when
cruise engages, and there is no setting for it. It would be the only feature here
that changes how the car puts power down without the driver asking, so it was
paused by decision — and the safety requirements were agreed at that point, which
is why it is a short job when it is picked up rather than a fresh design:

* opt-in setting, off by default, and it says on the glass when it is on;
* 2 s of debounce to enter *and* to leave;
* capture the mode on entry and restore exactly that — never "cycle to the next";
* any manual mode change wins, and switches it off for the rest of the ignition
  cycle;
* every change announced on the glass and on the console.

The signal evidence, the reasoning and the full requirements are in
[`docs/upgrades.md`](docs/upgrades.md) §13. It starts at the debounce, not at the
research.

### 1.5 adc2can as a relay sender — transport ready, decision open
The Forbes Automotive **adc2can** (8× 0–5 V sensors to CAN) shares the CAN relay
wire format with OpenHaldex by design: `cannow_proto.h` here is one of three
identical copies (see its header comment) and already names `CANN_K_ADC2CAN`.
So `can_relay.cpp` would decode its relayed car-bus frames and 29-bit sensor
frames today, and the CAN DATA page could show its sensors from a DBC for the
`0AD2C000` base id. No WiFi join is needed either — the relay is an unpaired
ESP-NOW broadcast and both sides sit on channel 1.

What is **not** built, and is deliberate rather than an oversight:

* **Sender acceptance is OpenHaldex-coupled.** `ohx_now.cpp` learns "its
  controller" from an `OhxStatus` packet whose embedded AP-SSID matches the
  configured SSID, and drops every CANN packet that is not from that MAC — the
  `kind` byte is not even consulted. An adc2can never sends `OhxStatus`, so it
  is filtered out. Whatever the fix (learn from a CANN header, a settings
  field), respect the intent: this is the one gate that stops the dash hearing
  a stranger's car in a paddock or queue.
* **No Haldex-shaped feed without a controller.** The Full (F) band, the mode
  tile and `/api/dashboard` polling all assume the C6; on an adc2can-only car
  the main band would stay `--`. What a dash without OpenHaldex *is* — the CAN
  DATA page plus gauges, or nothing beyond raw/CAN — is a product question,
  since can2gauge already covers the display-only road-car use well.
* **No command path, and none to build.** adc2can is one-way over the air; the
  dash would be display-only, which matches the house rule but means the mode
  tile must hide rather than transmit into silence.

Perspective: the interesting version is **both on one car** — adc2can sensors
alongside OpenHaldex data where the controller cannot help (Gen1 has no oil
temp/pressure; a race car wants exactly those). Making the dash a general
can2gauge replacement is not the goal. If picked up, start at the acceptance
gate; the decode side is free.

## 2. Verification gaps

Things built and believed, but not yet proven on the right hardware.

### 2.1 Other Haldex generations — **needs testers**
Everything layout-related was decided from a **Gen1** car. Gen1 has no boost
frame, no supply voltage, no Haldex temperatures and a chassis-CAN-only
handbrake, so:

* the **Full (B)** tile band (`SPEED | BOOST | TEMPERATURES | HALDEX`) has
  never been rendered on a car that fills all four panels;
* `boost` scaling is the one field nobody has ever seen move — the packet
  documents it as *mbar above ambient*, and that is an assumption until a
  Gen4/5 car proves it;
* the capability table's "table" half (boost from generation) has only ever
  been exercised on the car that *lacks* the source;
* Gen2/4/50/52 differences still unknown: which generations fill `slip[4]`,
  and whether steering arrives both ways as it does on Gen1. (`oilTemp` is
  settled: the packet's is Haldex oil, Gen4 only, and the OIL tile no longer
  uses it. HTTP oil is engine oil from the Kombi.)

The raw telemetry page (`x`) exists for exactly this: it shows every field
raw, so a tester can report back without a laptop and without this agent.

### 2.2 The CAN relay in the car
Built and believed, not yet measured. What it costs in render rate, how much it
loses in the air at this car's −76 to −86 dBm (the controller sends at 6 Mbit/s
while relaying, which has less margin than the 1 Mbit/s the link was measured at),
and which relay setting to recommend. MQB coolant and oil from `Motor_07` have
never been on a car through this path. The whole test is in
[`docs/can-relay-test.md`](docs/can-relay-test.md).

The bench half of this is now done (0.6.0): with no controller in range the panel
runs at 61.8 fps and internal RAM holds at 163 KB free, so the PSRAM moves are no
longer the worry they were. What the *relay* costs — render rate and loss with the frames
actually arriving — can only be measured on the car, and the procedure covers the
fuel, odometer, indicator and 58s values too, since those arrive the same way.

### 2.3 A wrong *project* image is accepted
The IDF refuses an image for another chip (verified in its source:
`mismatch chip ID, expected %d, found %d`, on the same verify path
`Update.end()` uses). It does **not** care whose project the image is, so a
valid ESP32-S3 image that is not this dashboard would be written, would boot,
and would never stand the trial down — leaving a trial armed in NVS for the
next real boot to trip over.

The fix, in `handleUploadDone()`: after `Update.end(true)`, read the app
descriptor out of the target partition (`esp_partition_read` at
`16 + 8 * segment_count`, rounded up) and compare `project_name` with this
project. On a mismatch, point the boot partition back at the running slot and
report it. The running image is untouched either way.

**Not done because it cannot be tested from here** — the update page is only
reachable from the controller's access point, and the controller's access
point is out of range of the development machine. Until then the README says
plainly: take the file from this repository's releases and nothing else.

### 2.4 The unexplained reset
One reset, 8 s after the first post-update boot, while the station was
re-associating. No panic, a clean ROM banner, no repeats in 180 s of idle
running afterwards, and the trial logic handled it correctly in passing.

Leading hypothesis: a supply sag. The panel and the WiFi share a rail with
very little margin on a USB port, and the reset landed in the middle of
association retries. The other candidate has since been removed: until 0.4.2 a
rejoin shut the WiFi driver down with ESP-NOW still running on top of it. The boot banner now prints `reset : <reason>`
(power-on / software / PANIC / watchdog / BROWNOUT), so the next occurrence
answers the question instead of prompting another guess. Watch it on the car's
supply, which is a different animal.

### 2.5 Link margin
The ESP-NOW link sits at −76 to −86 dBm in the car and delivers 6–9 Hz rather
than the full 10, with occasional gaps. Nothing is wrong with the code —
broadcast has no retransmission — but the dash would look better with the S3
moved ~20 cm away from whatever it is currently sitting next to.

Worth trying when someone has the car apart: a position that gets to −70 dBm,
and measuring `[stats] esp-now … Hz` before and after.

## 3. Requested, and worth doing

### 3.1 Display scaling / other panel sizes
Currently out of scope, and worth stating precisely why: `theme.h` is a
list of absolute pixel positions derived from the browser page's geometry
(`u = min(w/100, h/56)`, 8 px at 800×480). Nothing scales.

The **5.0" CrowPanel** is the same 800×480, so it should fit as-is and needs
only a board variant — different pins, touch controller and possibly less
PSRAM, which matters more than the resolution: the two 800×480×16bpp
framebuffers are 1.5 MB and cannot live in internal RAM. Check the 5" board's
PSRAM *before* anything else.

For a genuinely different resolution, the honest options are (a) express
`theme.h` in terms of a scale factor and multiply, (b) convert the layout to
LVGL flex/grid, or (c) accept per-resolution variants. (a) is the smallest
change and keeps the "one file holds the geometry" property.

### 3.2 More of the controller's own controls
The mode switch is the thin end of a wedge. The same signed-command path
already carries learn start/cancel/clear, generation, and controller on/off
(see `ohx_proto.h`). Each one is a decision, not a port: generation and learn
need the car stopped, and "controller off" while driving is a conversation.

### 3.3 Things that arrive for free and have nowhere to go
Per-wheel slip (`slip[4]`), steering angle (packet-only on Gen1), supply
voltage, Haldex clutch/oil/module temperatures. All decoded, all shown on the
raw page, none on the dashboard — because this car cannot fill them. Space
them once a Gen4/5 tester exists (see 2.1).

### 3.4 Smaller polish
* Scale up the big SPEED number — noted as not urgent, since speed matters
  least on a racecar-style dash, but it is inconsistent with rpm.
* A QR code on the SETTINGS page for the update URL, to kill the last bit of
  typing on a phone.

## 4. Technical debt

### 4.1 `CONFIG_BOOTLOADER_APP_ROLLBACK_ENABLE`
The IDF's own rollback is the right home for the update trial. Enabling it
means `custom_sdkconfig`, which forces a full framework rebuild against the
shared core directory — measured, and it does not currently succeed for this
platform release (`libsodium` fails to compile once the regenerated sdkconfig
drops its defines). Revisit if upstream fixes the rebuild; the application's
trial can be deleted the same day.

The application-level version cannot catch a crash that happens before our
code runs. The IDF's version can.

### 4.2 The `coredump` partition is unused
It exists in the partition table and nothing writes to it. Enabling core
dumps, and a way to read one back out (over the update page would be neat),
would turn a field crash from "it rebooted" into a stack trace.

### 4.3 Render performance
The loop is PSRAM-bandwidth bound, not HTTP bound (see
[`docs/display-and-memory.md`](docs/display-and-memory.md)), so the
rate follows the radio: 16–35 fps while a phone or the controller is pushing
traffic through WiFi, and **61.8 fps on the bench with nothing in range** (0.6.0,
which also cut the polling to a single cross-check request a second). What it does
in the car with the relay arriving has not been measured. The pixel clock is
deliberately left where it is known to be stable. The `p` and `b` console keys
remain the fastest way to explore it if anyone wants more.

### 4.4 Report upstream: the steering inconsistency
`/api/dashboard` gates `steeringAngle` on `steerSupported = (gen == 2 || 4 ||
50 || 52)`, so on Gen1 the JSON field is `null` — while the ESP-NOW packet
carries the same `received_steering_angle` for the same car, and so does the
BLE characteristic. The CAN decoder supports PQ `LW_1` (0x0C2) *and* MQB
`LWI_01`, so the platform is deliberately supported one layer down and then
excluded at the API. It shows in the controller's own web UI too
(`data/app.js` renders `steeringAngle`), and `steeringHealthy` is `false` on
Gen1, so a client that trusts the health flag is misinformed rather than
merely uninformed.

The dash uses the packet and is unaffected; the raw page and `e` on the
console show both transports side by side. The evidence, the three-path
comparison and a suggested fix are written up ready to paste in
[`docs/upstream-steering-report.md`](docs/upstream-steering-report.md).

### 4.5 `ohx_proto.h` and `cannow_proto.h` must be refreshed from upstream
They are verbatim copies of the controller's shared headers. If the C6's struct
changes and this copy does not, the `static_assert` on the packet size will
catch it — but only if someone looks. Worth a note in the release checklist.
