"""Read the console.

Opening this board's console port reboots it. That is measured, not assumed:
with a 12 s gap between two runs the second run still begins with a full boot
banner, so the reset comes from the kernel asserting DTR/RTS as the port is
opened - before any userspace code can set the lines. HUPCL is cleared and the
lines are dropped on open, which keeps the *close* from pulsing them as well.

What this tool is for, given that: it opens once and holds the port, so a whole
session of console keys and gestures is not reset halfway through. Use
serial_capture.py when a reset is what you want.
