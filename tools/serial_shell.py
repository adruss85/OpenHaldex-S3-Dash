"""Hold the console open, log it to a file, and send keys into it.

Opening this board's serial port resets the ESP32 (measured: it happens on
open, at the kernel level, before this code runs). This process therefore opens
the port ONCE and keeps it, appending everything the board prints to a log
file and sending the contents of a command file whenever one appears - so a
whole session of gestures and console keys is not reset halfway through, which
is what matters when you are watching a live car.

usage:  serial_shell.py <logfile> [seconds] [port] [baud]
        echo -n r > <logfile>.cmd        # sends "r"; the file is removed
        echo -n t > <logfile>.cmd        # resets the touch probe
