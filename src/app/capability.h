// capability.h - what this car can actually fill
//
// The dashboard's shape is chosen, once at boot, from what the controller
// says it can feed. Two ways of finding out, in this order of preference:
//
//   detected   the packet marks a field it has no value for with a sentinel
//              (OHX_NONE8 / OHX_NONE16 / OHX_NONE_T), which reaches us as NaN.
//              supply voltage, the Haldex-side temperatures and the steering
//              angle are all detectable this way, and detection is preferred
//              because it is the car telling us rather than us assuming.
//
//   table      boost is the exception: the controller has no absence sentinel
//              for it, so a car whose chassis CAN carries no boost frame
//              reads a confident 0.00 rather than "no value" and cannot be
//              detected at all. It is therefore decided from the Haldex
//              generation, which is the only thing we have that correlates.
//              Measured on the Gen1 car this was written against: Motor_7
//              (0x588) is the only PQ boost frame and it is not broadcast,
//              so boost never moves.
//
// The decision is made once and latched. It is not re-evaluated per frame: a
// layout that changed shape while the car was moving would be worse than a
// widget that reads "--". It is, however, revised at most once if the
// generation only becomes known after the decision settled - see poll().
